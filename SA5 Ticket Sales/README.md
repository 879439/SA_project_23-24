# SA5 TICKET SALES 

This is the Readme file of SA5 Ticket Sales. It takes you through the procedural steps of the entire project.

This project entails an airline ticket sales system developed to provide an easy, reliable and option-filled tickets for customers to choose from. The application allows for the search, evaluation, booking/sales/reservation of airline tickets. It also provides the option to the above without the need to register.

Alternatively, the customers that are registered can get access to other features of the system such as the 'myBooking' tab from which all the bookings or tickets bought can be viewed and doiwnloaded at all times.
